# This is a Lightning Stream (LS) example configuration for use with the
# the PowerDNS Authoritative DNS server (PDNS Auth) LMDB backend.
# This example configuration is based on version 4.8 of PDNS Auth, which
# uses a native LS compatible schema. This version has not been released yet as
# of Feb 2023.
# This example aims to document all available options. If an option is
# commented out, its default value is shown, unless indicated otherwise.

# Every instance of LS requires a unique instance name. This instance name
# is included in the snapshot filenames and used by instances to discover
# snapshots by other instances.
# LS supports the expansion of OS environment variables in YAML configs, with
# values like ${INSTANCE}, which can simplify the management of multiple
# instances.
instance: unique-instance-name

# Check the LMDBs for newly written transactions at this interval, and write
# a new snapshot if anything has changed. The check is very cheap.
#lmdb_poll_interval: 1s

# Periodically log LMDB statistics.
# Useful when investigating issues based on logs. Defaults to 30m.
lmdb_log_stats_interval: 5m
# Include LMDB memory usage statistics from /proc/$PID/smaps for metrics.
# This can be expensive on some older kernel versions when a lot of memory
# is mapped.

# Check the storage for new snapshots at this interval
#storage_poll_interval: 1s

# When a download or upload fails, these items determine how often and at what
# interval we will retry, before existing LS with an error.
#storage_retry_interval: 5s
#storage_retry_count: 100
#storage_retry_forever: false

# Force a snapshot once in a while, even if there were no local changes, so
# that this instance will not be seen as stale, or removed by external cleaning
# actions.
# Note that external cleaning mechanisms are not recommended, it is safer to use
# the 'storage.cleanup' section.
#storage_force_snapshot_interval: 4h

# Equivalent to the --only-once flag.
#only_once: false

# The 'lmdbs' section defines which LMDB database need to be synced. LS will
# start one internal syncer instance per database.
# The keys in this section ('main' and 'shard' here) are arbitrary names
# assigned to these databases. These names are used in logging and in the
# snapshot filenames, so they must match between instances and not be changed
# later.
lmdbs:
  # In PDNS Auth, this database contains all the data, except for the records.
  main:
    # Path to the LMDB database. This is typically the directory containing
    # a 'data.mdb' and 'lock.mdb' file, but PDNS Auth uses the 'no_subdir'
    # option, in which case this is a path to the data file itself.
    path: /path/to/pdns.lmdb

    # LMDB environment options
    options:
      # If set, the LMDB path refers to a file, not a directory.

      #file_mask: 0664

      # The LMDB mapsize when creating the LMDB. This is the amount of memory
      # that can be used for LMDB data pages and limits the file size of an
      # LMDB. Keep in mind that an LMDB file can eventually grow to its mapsize.
      # A value of 0 means 1GB when creating a new LMDB.

    # This indicates that the application natively supports LS headers on all
    # its database values. PDNS Auth supports this starting from version 4.8.
    # Earlier versions required this to be set to 'false'.
    # Application requirements include, but are not limited to:
    # - Every value is prefixed with an 24+ byte LS header.
    # - Deleted entries are recorded with the same timestamp and a Deleted flag.
    # When enabled, a shadow database is no longer needed to merge snapshots, and
    # conflict resolution is both more accurate and more efficient.
    schema_tracks_changes: true

    # Older versions of PDNS Auth (4.7) require this to be enabled to handle

    #header_extra_padding_block: false

    # This allows setting options per-DBI.
    # Currently, the only option supported is 'override_create_flags', which is
    # should only be used when you need both options.create=true
    # and have snapshots created by a pre-0.3.0 version of LS. Newer snapshots
    # have all the information they need to create new DBIs.
